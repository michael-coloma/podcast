# Testing

Testing your application is a vital part of serious development. There are a few
things you should test. We are using jest to implement them.


## Usage

1.  Create `*.test.tsx` or `*.test.ts` files directly next to the parts of your application you
    want to test. Fox example, component Filter.tsx with Filter.test.tsx.

2.  Write your unit and component tests in those files

3.  Run `npm run test` in your terminal and see all the tests pass! (hopefully)
